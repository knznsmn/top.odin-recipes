      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled Lemon Yogurt Chicken is a delightful dish that combines the bright, citrusy flavors of lemon with the creamy tanginess of yogurt to create a tender and flavorful chicken entrée.</p>
        <p>
          Boneless chicken breasts are marinated in a mixture of Greek yogurt, freshly squeezed lemon juice, minced garlic, and a medley of herbs and spices such as oregano, thyme, and paprika. This marinade not only infuses the chicken with layers of zesty flavor but also helps to tenderize the meat, resulting in juicy and succulent grilled chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the chicken grills over an open flame, the marinade caramelizes and forms a golden crust, sealing in the juices and enhancing the overall depth of flavor. The addition of lemon zest adds a burst of citrusy aroma and brightness to each bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once grilled to perfection, the chicken is garnished with fresh herbs and served alongside vibrant sides such as a Greek salad, roasted vegetables, or couscous. The combination of tender grilled chicken with the refreshing tang of lemon and yogurt makes this dish a perfect choice for a light and satisfying meal, whether enjoyed on a warm summer evening or as a flavorful addition to any gathering.

        <h3>Yogurt Sauce:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>½ cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon harissa</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Whisk together yogurt, garlic, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, paprika, herbes de Provence, salt, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; stir to coat. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
          </li>
          <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt, lemon juice, and harissa in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove chicken to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels; discard marinade. Pat chicken dry with more paper towels. Season with a pinch of salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 2 minutes. Turn over each piece and move to indirect heat. Continue grilling, turning often, with the lid down until well browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve chicken with sauce on the side.
          </li>
