          Aztec Chicken with Sweet Potato-Corn Mash is a tantalizing fusion dish that combines the bold flavors of Aztec cuisine with comforting ingredients like sweet potatoes and corn. Tender chicken breasts are marinated in a zesty blend of spices inspired by traditional Aztec flavors, including cumin, chili powder, garlic, and lime juice. The chicken is then grilled to perfection, imparting a smoky char and locking in the juicy tenderness.

          Alongside the flavorful chicken, a creamy and sweet mash of roasted sweet potatoes and corn provides a delightful contrast of textures and tastes. The sweet potatoes are roasted until caramelized and tender, then mashed together with golden corn kernels to create a velvety and slightly sweet base. A touch of warm spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg may be added to enhance the aromatic profile of the mash.

          <li>2 teaspoons Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Cholula®)</li>
          <li>6 (8 ounce) bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sweet Potato-Corn Mash:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>5 ears corn</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine oil, honey, ancho chile powder, garlic, and hot sauce in a bowl; whisk together. Place chicken breasts in a large resealable plastic bag; pour in marinade and close bag. Marinate in refrigerator, 3 hours to overnight.</li>
          <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Place sweet potatoes on a baking sheet. Place corn in a shallow baking pan. Brush with canola oil; season with salt and pepper. Cover pan with aluminum foil.</li>
          <li>Allow corn and sweet potatoes to cool until easy to handle, about 20 minutes. Cut kernels from ears of corn; transfer half to a blender. Peel and cube sweet potatoes; add to the blender. Add cream; puree. Transfer mash to a bowl; stir in the remaining corn. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm.</li>
          <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
          <li>Remove chicken from bag and place on preheated grill; discard remaining marinade. Cook until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Cut chicken breasts into 3 equal pieces; serve on top of sweet potato-corn mash.</li>
        </ol>
